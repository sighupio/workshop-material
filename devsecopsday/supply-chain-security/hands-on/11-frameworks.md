# Supply Chain Security Frameworks

As we have seen, *supply chain security* is a crucial aspect of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of software and hardware components.  
Several frameworks have been developed to guide organizations in enhancing their supply chain security practices.  
This page explores two notable frameworks – SLSA and S2C2F – along with others.  
## Supply Chain Security Frameworks
### 1. SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

As we have already seen in this workshop, *SLSA* is a framework developed by Google in collaboration with industry partners to establish trust and enhance supply chain security.  
It aims to improve the integrity of software artifacts by defining verifiable security requirements and promoting transparency throughout the software development and delivery lifecycle.  

Key features of SLSA include: 
- **Bill of Materials (BoM):**  SLSA requires a comprehensive BoM for all software artifacts, listing the components and dependencies used.  
- **Software Component Analysis:**  It encourages organizations to perform rigorous analysis and vulnerability assessments of software components.  
- **Software Transparency:**  SLSA promotes transparency by requiring software artifacts to be cryptographically signed and providing transparency logs for auditing and traceability purposes.  
- **Software Lifecycle Requirements:**  SLSA defines requirements for different levels (ranging from 0 to 5) of security and trustworthiness throughout the software's lifecycle.  
### 2. S2C2F (Software Component Certification Framework)

S2C2F is an open-source framework developed by the Linux Foundation's OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation) project.  
It aims to enhance supply chain security by establishing a certification program for software components based on security and quality criteria.

Key features of S2C2F include: 
- **Component Certification:**  S2C2F provides a mechanism to certify software components based on predefined security and quality standards. 
- **Vulnerability Scanning:**  It encourages organizations to regularly scan components for known vulnerabilities and take appropriate actions. 
- **Auditing and Compliance:**  S2C2F emphasizes regular audits and compliance checks to ensure adherence to security and quality requirements. 
- **Maintainer Guidelines:**  It offers guidelines for software component maintainers to enhance the security and trustworthiness of their components.

### 3. Other Prominent Digital Supply Chain Security Frameworks

In addition to the widely recognized frameworks like SLSA and S2C2F, several other renowned frameworks are instrumental in strengthening digital supply chain security practices.  
These frameworks offer valuable guidance and standards to ensure the security and resilience of software and hardware components.  
Let's explore a few of the most prominent ones: 
- **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS):**  OWASP SCVS is a comprehensive framework that focuses on verifying the security of software components used within the supply chain.  
It provides guidelines for assessing component security, conducting vulnerability assessments, and ensuring robust security controls throughout the supply chain.  
- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Framework:**  NIST C-SCRM Framework offers a structured approach to manage and mitigate cyber supply chain risks.  
It provides organizations with guidelines for assessing and managing supply chain risks, establishing trusted relationships with suppliers, and implementing security controls to safeguard against potential threats.
