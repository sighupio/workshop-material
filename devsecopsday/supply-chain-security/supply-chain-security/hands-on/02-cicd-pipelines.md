# CI/CD Pipelines

In software engineering, CI/CD is the combined practices of continuous integration (CI)  
and continuous delivery (CD) or, less often, continuous deployment.  
They are sometimes referred to collectively as continuous development or continuous software development.  

<br/>

By automating CI/CD throughout development, testing, production, and monitoring phases of the software development lifecycle  
organizations are able to develop higher quality code, faster.  
Although itâ€™s possible to manually execute each of the steps of a CI/CD pipeline, the true value of CI/CD pipelines is realized through automation.

<br/>


This repo contains a working implementation of a [tekton](https://tekton.dev/) pipeline.  
`Tekton` is a cloud native framework for crafting CI/CD pipelines.  
Once again, for cloud native we mean that it runs on Kubernetes.  

In Tekton, every task that makes up a pipeline runs in a separate kubernetes pod.


<br/>


We implement a tekton pipeline that does the following:
1. *clone* a public git repository
2. does *linting* against the *Makefile*
3. does *linting* against the *README*
4. *SAST* analysis to search for *hardcoded secrets* (api keys, tokens, passwords) in the repository
5. does *linting* against the python code
6. executes a python *unit test*
7. does *linting* and *OPA Conftest* rules checking against the *dockerfile*
8. does *linting* and *OPA Conftest* rules checking against the *helm/k8s manifests*
9. *build* the *OCI image*
10. *scan* the builded image for vulnerabilities
11. push the scanned image to a *remote 'production' docker registry*
12. *sign* the image via a custom *cosign* task (this can also be done via <a href="https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/">tekton chains</a>)
13. *deploy* the application via *helm* on the local K8s cluster

Some tasks (eg. the linting and testing ones) are run in parallel to speed up the pipeline execution.  
In a real world scenario it is recommended to execute some tasks (eg. SAST, linting) via [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/).  

Here is an high-level example on how a secure pipeline looks like:

**Note**: this repository is intended as a demo on a disposable local development environment, this is not suitable for production.
