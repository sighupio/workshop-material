# Question - ETCD Snaphsot

1. Backup etcd on `/home/workshop/etcd-backup.db`.

2. Create a Pod running `registry.sighup.io/workshop/nginx` in the cluster.

3. Finally restore the backup, confirm the cluster is still working and that the created Pod is no longer with us.

## Solution

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 /usr/local/bin/etcdctl \
    --cacert="/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt" \
    --cert="/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.crt" \
    --key="/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.key" \
    snapshot save /home/workshop/etcd-backup.db
```
