# Question - Scheduler

1. Temporarily stop the scheduler from running by executing `sudo /root/cka_5.sh`

2. Create a single Pod named `manual-schedule` with the image `registry.sighup.io/workshop/httpd:latest`.

3. Check the node status. Is it running?

4. Try to manually schedule the pod on a worker node

5. Try to fix the problem with the scheduler.

Extra:

Extract all logs `/home/workshop/scheduler.log`

### Solution

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: manual-schedule
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry.sighup.io/workshop/httpd:latest
    name: haproxy
  nodeName: ip-172-31-4-84.eu-west-1.compute.internal
```

```bash
kubectl logs kube-scheduler-master -n kube-system > /opt/outputs/scheduler.log
```
