# Question 2 - Pod Labels

Deploy a pod with name `child` with the image `registry.sighup.io/workshop/redis:alpine` in the default namespace. 
The pod shoud have a label `fruit=pineapple`.

After the pod creation, create a replicaset called `parent` that will adopt the pod `child`.

Check the desired and current pods in the replica set are correct.
Try to delete the pod `child` and see if another one is created.

## Solution

Create the `child` pod:

```bash
kubectl run child \
  --image=registry.sighup.io/workshop/redis:alpine 
  --labels=fruit=pineapple
```

or (better) using a `child.yaml` file:

```yaml
# file: child.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: child
  labels:
    fruit: pineapple
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry.sighup.io/workshop/redis:alpine
    name: child
```

Apply the manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f child.yaml
```

Create a `parent.yaml` for the replicaset:

```yaml
# file: parent.yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: parent
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      fruit: pineapple
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        fruit: pineapple
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.sighup.io/workshop/redis:alpine
        name: child
```

Apply the manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f parent.yaml
```

Delete the `child` pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod child
```
