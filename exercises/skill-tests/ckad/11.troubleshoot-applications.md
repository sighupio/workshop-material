# Question 11 - Troubleshooting applications

Inside the namespace `everything-works` there is a `website` deployment which is currently not working.
Identify the problem and fix it.

## Solution

The deployment `website` has wrong `readiness` and `liveness` probe.
Change the `httpGet.path` to a working path (e.g. `/`):

```yaml
  livenessProbe:
    failureThreshold: 3
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 80
      scheme: HTTP
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 10
    successThreshold: 1
    timeoutSeconds: 5
  readinessProbe:
    failureThreshold: 3
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 80
      scheme: HTTP
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 10
    successThreshold: 1
    timeoutSeconds: 5
```

Wait for the pods to be running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n everything-works
```
