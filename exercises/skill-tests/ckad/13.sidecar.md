# Question 13 - Sidecar

Create a pod called `writer-reader` in the `default` namespace with following specifications:

- Use an emptyDir volume called `shared`.
- Have a container `writer` running `registry.sighup.io/workshop/busybox` that mounts the `shared` volume at `/opt/app_logs/` and writes `hello` in a file `/opt/app_logs/wave.log`
- Another container `reader` running `registry.sighup.io/workshop/ubuntu` that outputs the file created by the other container to stout.

Extract the first 10 lines of the logs of the `reader` container at `/home/workshop/multi.logs`.

## Solution

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -  
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: writer-reader
  name: writer-reader
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry.sighup.io/workshop/busybox
    name: writer
    volumeMounts:
      - name: shared
        mountPath: /opt/app_logs
    command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "--" ]
    args: [ "while true; do echo hello >> /opt/app_logs/wave.log; sleep 1; done;" ]
  - image: registry.sighup.io/workshop/ubuntu
    name: reader
    volumeMounts:
      - name: shared
        mountPath: /opt/app_logs
    command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "--" ]
    args: [ "tail -f /opt/app_logs/wave.log" ]
  volumes:
    - name: shared
      emptyDir: {}
EOF
```

Extact the logs with: `kubectl logs writer-reader -c reader | head -n 10  >  /home/workshop/multi.logs`
