# Question 17 - Network policy

0. Create the namespace `policy`.

1. Create a pod `busybox`:
  
- with image `registry.sighup.io/workshop/busybox:latest`
- with label `type=client`
- in the namespace `policy`
- that executes the command `sleep 3600`

2. Create a pod `cannot`:

- with image `registry.sighup.io/workshop/busybox:latest`
- with label `type=hacker`
- in the namespace `policy`
- that executes the command `sleep 3600`

3. Create a deployment `httpd`:

- with the image `registry.sighup.io/workshop/httpd:latest`
- in the namespace `policy`
- that exposes the `containerPort` 80

4. Expose the deployment internally `httpd` via a service at port `80`.

5. Create a network policy that allows the `busybox` to talk to the `httpd` deployment on the port `80` but blocks the access from all other pods.

## Solution

1. Create the deployments

2. Create the following network policy

Block everything except DNS resolution:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
  namespace: policy
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  egress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 53
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
```

Create a policy `allow-busybox-to-httpd` that allows the deployment `busybox` to talk to `httpd`

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-busybox-to-httpd
spec:
  podSelector: 
    matchLabels:
      type: client
  egress:
    - to:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            type: webserver
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
```

Verify that the deployment can't talk to `httpd`.
